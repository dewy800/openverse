## Overview

<!-- A brief one or two sentence overview of the implementation being described. -->

This document describes how we will implement a mechanism for updating the
staging database with the latest data from the production database.

## Outlined Steps

<!-- Describe the implementation step necessary for completion. -->

The final product of this plan will be a DAG (scheduled for `@monthly`) which
will recreate the staging database from the most recent snapshot of the
production API database. This will be accomplished by:

1.
